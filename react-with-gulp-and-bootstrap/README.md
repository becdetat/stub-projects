# React with Gulp and Bootstrap

A stub project including:

- Gulp
- React
- SASS
- Babel
- Bootstrap (SASS)
- Bourbon

Plus some custom styles to get the default page looking reasonable.

Set it up by running `all-the-things.bat`, which will initialise NPM then install all the required dependencies. Then run `gulp` to build the site and write it to `output/`. There's no server, just open `index.html` in a browser.
